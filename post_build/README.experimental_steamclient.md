## What is this ?
This is a build of the `experimental` version of the emu in `steamclient` mode, with an included loader which was originally [written by Rat431](https://github.com/Rat431/ColdAPI_Steam/tree/master/src/ColdClientLoader) and later modified to suite the needs of this emu.  

The backend .dll/.so of Steam is a library called `steamclient`, this build will act as a `steamclient` allowing you to retain the original `steam_api(64).dll`.  
See both the regular and experimental readmes for how to configure it.

---

**Note** that all emu config files should be put beside the `steamclient(64).dll`.  
You do not need to create a `steam_interfaces.txt` file for the `steamclient` version of the emu.

## How to ue it ?
1. Copy the following files to any folder:  
   * `steamclient.dll`
   * `steamclient64.dll`
   * `ColdClientLoader.ini`
   * `steamclient_loader.exe`
2. Edit `ColdClientLoader.ini` and specify:
   * `AppId`: the app ID
   * `Exe`: the path to the game's executable/launcher, either full path or relative to this `.ini` file
   * `ExeRunDir`: geenrally this must be set to the folder containing the game's exe
   * `ExeCommandLine` additional args to pass to the exe, example: `-dx11 -windowed`  
   Optionally you can specify a different location for `steamclient(64).dll`:  
   * `SteamClientDll`: path to `steamclient.dll`, either full path or relative to this `.ini` file
   * `SteamClientDll`: path to `steamclient(64).dll`, either full path or relative to this `.ini` file

**Note** that any arguments passed to `steamclient_loader.exe` via command line will be passed to the target `.exe`.  
Example: `steamclient_loader.exe` `-dx11`  
If the additional exe arguments were both: passed via command line and set in the `.ini` file, then both will be cocatenated and passed to the exe.  
This allows the loader to be used/called from other external apps which set additional args.
